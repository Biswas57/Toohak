# Toohak!
### A Modern Quiz Tool for University Students

## Overview
Toohak! is a next-generation quiz tool designed to provide an engaging and effective learning experience for university students. While traditional tools like Kahoot! are popular, they often fall short in flexibility, customizability, and user engagement. Toohak! offers a dynamic platform with advanced features tailored to meet the needs of both students and educators, making exam preparation more comprehensive and enjoyable.

### Problem:
Traditional quiz tools such as Kahoot! often lack the flexibility and features required for higher education. They provide limited question types, minimal integration with educational content, and basic interfaces that do not fully engage or challenge students. Moreover, they do not offer sufficient feedback or analytics for tracking progress and learning outcomes.

### Solution:
Toohak! is a versatile and powerful quiz platform designed specifically for university students and educators. It provides advanced features, such as customizable quiz formats, real-time feedback, progress tracking, and integration with educational resources. With Toohak!, students can experience an intuitive and interactive learning environment that enhances their preparation for exams more effectively than traditional tools.

### Development and Implementation:

- **Deployment**: Utilized Vercel for seamless deployment, ensuring a stable and scalable environment for the Toohak! platform.

### User-Centric Design:
Toohak! was developed based on direct feedback from university students and educators. The design process involved iterative user testing and feedback loops, ensuring that the platform meets the real-world needs of its target audience.

### Future Enhancements:
Plans to expand Toohak! include adding more interactive elements, enhancing integration capabilities with a wider range of educational platforms, and developing a community engagement feature to further enhance the collaborative learning experience.
