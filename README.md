# Toohak!
### Kahoot! Emulator API

### Problem: 
Kahoot! is overrated, ain't even that good, overused and if your on it at the ripe old age of around 20 then you're a bit basic mate
### Solution: 
Toohak! is the new and slightly improved quizzing website for Uni students only if you're a cool person, not for the light-hearted, will prepare you much better for your exams than Kahoot! ever could.

●	Developed a Kahoot! emulator API (backend), in TypeScript and JavaScript using Node.js and Express.js.

●	Implemented a full suite of HTTP methods for CRUD operations, to implement data retrieval and important quiz functionalities.

●	Collaborated in a team of 5 to integrate the ‘Toohak!’ API, achieving project milestones over the course of two months.
