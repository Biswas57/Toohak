# Toohak!
### Kahoot! Emulator API

### Problem: 
Kahoot! is overrated, ain't even that good, overused and if you're using it at the ripe old age of around 20 then you're a bit basic mate
### Solution: 
Toohak! is the new and slightly improved quizzing website for Uni students only if you're a cool person, not for the light-hearted, will prepare you much better for your exams than Kahoot! ever could.

- Developed a Kahoot! emulator API (backend), in TypeScript and JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js and Express.js.
- Designing and implementing a web quiz CRUD application which allows users to create, review and complete quizzes utilising correct OOP practices (SOLID)
- Collaborated in a team of 5 using Gitlab to integrate the ‘Toohak!’ API with a full suite of HTTP requests, achieving project milestones over 2 months.
